- LRU.
- Spread the interval logically across a time period so multiple URLs aren't
  all fetched at the same time.
- Circuit break the polling and send to sleep if something is broken.
- Annotate requests with latency information
- Promise based interface, Eg.
- Respond to a X-Header to kill off the polling via the server

    new Poller()
        .get('example.com/foo')
        .withInterval(2000)
        .initialFetch(true)
        .then(function (response) {
            foo = response.text;
        })
